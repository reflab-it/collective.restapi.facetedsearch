================================
collective.restapi.facetedsearch
================================

This addon provides Plone-REST-Api endpoints for a faceted search. The GET endpoint is highly inspired by the REST-Api search and the POST endpoint is highly inspired by the REST-Api querystringsearch. Configuration of facets must be done by overloading GroupByCriteria of collective.collectionfilter

Features
========

- GET endpoint ``@faceted-search`` can be used like the 'normal' search-endpoint of the REST-Api ``@search``, but it calculates and adds requested facets to the result set
- GET endpoint can list all available and configured facets
- POST endpoint ``@faceted-search`` can be used like the querystring search-endpoint of the REST-Api ``@querystring-search``, but it calculates and adds requested facets to the result set


Documentation
=============

GET endpoint
------------
``@faceted-search``

This endpoint accepts all parameter of the 'normal' search endpoint of the REST Api like ``b_size``, ``sort_on`` etc, and additionally three more: ``facets``, ``facets_only`` and ``possible_facets``.
To get a list of all available and configured facets add parameter ``possible_facets=1`` to the request.
Choose one or more of the available facets and add them as stringlist parameter  ``facets`` to the request. The search response json will be extended with object property "facets", and each of the facets contains a list with all item occurences of the facet in the resultset and the count how often they appear on the resultset


POST endpoint
------------
``@faceted-search``

This endpoint accepts all parameter from the querystring-search endpoint of the REST Api, like ``query``, ``sort_on`` etc, and additionally three more: ``facets``, ``facets_only`` and ``possible_facets``. Provide the parameter in the request body as it is a post request.

Choose one or more of the available facets and add them as stringlist parameter  ``facets`` to the request.
The search response json will be extended with object property "facets", and each of the facets contains a list with all item occurences of the facet in the resultset and the count how often they appear on the resultset

Configuration of facets
-----------------------

Configuration is done by overloading collective.collectionfilter GroupByCriteria.
